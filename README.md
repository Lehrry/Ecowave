## Project Overview
EcoWave is a comprehensive web design project created as part of a WordPress Developer assignment for SoluLab. This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and Sass files used to implement the design created for the project. The goal of EcoWave is to provide a professional and responsive website for an environmental consulting firm, showcasing advanced web development practices and design aesthetics.

## Design Phase
The design phase began with creating detailed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using Figma. This phase was crucial for defining the visual and structural elements of the website.

## Development Phase
The development phase focuses on translating the design mockups into a fully functional, responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Sass.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the website.
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor used for the first time in this project to create modular and maintainable styles.

### Current Progress:
- **Home Page**: Completed for mobile screens, with plans to add breakpoints for tablet and desktop versions.
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (460px), Tablet (980px), and Desktop (1200px).

### Above progress has been completed
I have made the website fully responsive across screen sizes. I used breakpoints 480px and 1020. as opposed to 460px and 980px. This is in order to accommodate large screen sizes above 990px. 

Added javascript for menu interaction
