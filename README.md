## Project Overview
EcoWave is a comprehensive web design project created as part of a WordPress Developer assignment for SoluLab. This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and Sass files used to implement the design created for the project. The goal of EcoWave is to provide a professional and responsive website for an environmental consulting firm, showcasing advanced web development practices and design aesthetics.

## Design Phase
The design phase began with creating detailed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using Figma. This phase was crucial for defining the visual and structural elements of the website.

### Pages Designed:
1. **Home Page**: Welcome message, brief description, call-to-action button, and a featured section with the latest blog posts.
2. **About Us**: Company history, team member introductions with photos and bios, and customer testimonials.
3. **Services**: Detailed descriptions of services offered with pricing information.
4. **Blog**: Sample blog posts with engaging titles, dummy text, featured images, categories, and tags.
5. **Contact Us**: Contact form with fields for name, email, subject, message, and a Google Maps integration showing the business location.

## Development Phase
The development phase focuses on translating the design mockups into a fully functional, responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Sass.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the website.
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor used for the first time in this project to create modular and maintainable styles.

### Current Progress:
- **Home Page**: Completed for mobile screens, with plans to add breakpoints for tablet and desktop versions.
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (460px), Tablet (980px), and Desktop (1200px).
